# Abstrakct 🖼️ – Where Art Transcends, and Vision Endures

→ [Abstrakct Live](https://abstrakct.netlify.app/)

Welcome to **Abstrakct** – the art gallery where Da Vinci would've dropped his latest masterpiece (if he could figure out WiFi).

## The Vision Behind The Store 🖼️

Building this store was a blast, mostly because it's powered by the [Hydrogen Headless Framework](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev/). It's like giving your creativity a double espresso shot – all the flexibility, none of the limits.

The goal? Simple: make a gallery that's more than just a pretty face. I wanted buttery-smooth animations, lightning-fast performance, and a style that would make even the Mona Lisa crack a smile.

This isn't just a store. It's an experience. Here, the art feels alive, and every product has a story to tell (and it's not shy about it).

## Standout Features 💫

What makes **Abstrakct** a little extra?

### Live a Real Product Page Experience 🗽

- Product pages that don't just show you a painting—they tell you its story. 
- Every page is carefully curated, so you don't just scroll—you *feel* the art.
- Not your average "here's a product, now buy it" vibe. This is a gallery tour, not a checkout line.

### Predictive Search Implementation 🔍

- Search that reads your mind (an exaggeration that I came up with). Results pop up with every keystroke, so you're never left hanging.
- No friction, no fuss—just type and discover.
- Perfect for explorers, wanderers, and the "I forgot the name but it's blue" crowd.

### Smart Product Recommendations on Product Page 🙋🏽‍♂️

- Recommendations that actually make sense. (No, you won't get socks when you're looking at a painting.)
- Find your next favorite piece, even if you didn't know you were looking for it.

## Tech Stack ⚙️

Built with:

- [Hydrogen](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev/) – the backbone of this gallery
- [Remix](https://remix.run/) – for routes smoother than a fresh canvas
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) – because style matters
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) – for code that behaves
- [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.dev/) – for animations that don't just move, they dance
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) – because deploying should be as easy as hanging a painting (and yes, there were a few hoops to jump through)

## Experience **Abstrakct**! 🏁

Building Abstrakct was pure fun. Having the freedom to shape every pixel and every interaction made it a project worth every late-night coffee.

Give it a spin, wander around, and see if you don't fall in love with a painting or two. (Da Vinci would approve.)
